Convolutional Neural Network Implementation for MNIST Digit Recognition


1.	Data Preparation:

For data preparation in the MNIST digit recognition task, the first step is to load the dataset. The provided dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains pre-processed MNIST data in CSV format. The data contains 64 features representing pixel values (8x8 pixels) and one target column representing the digit label.
After loading the dataset, preprocessing steps are performed, including normalization and reshaping. Normalization is crucial to ensure that the pixel values are scaled to a range between 0 and 1, which helps in improving the convergence of the neural network during training. Reshaping is necessary to transform the data into the appropriate input shape expected by the CNN model. In this case, the data is reshaped to a 28x28 array representing the grayscale image with a single channel.

2.	Convolutional Neural Network Architecture:

The CNN architecture consists of 3 convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions. Each convolutional layer is followed by max-pooling layers, which help in reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while preserving important information. The dimensions of each layer are documented as follows:
Convolutional Layer 1: 32 filters with a kernel size of (3x3), resulting in feature maps of size (26x26).
Max Pooling Layer 1: Max pooling with a pool size of (2x2), reducing the feature map size to (13x13).
Convolutional Layer 2: 64 filters with a kernel size of (3x3), resulting in feature maps of size (11x11).
Max Pooling Layer 2: Max pooling with a pool size of (2x2), reducing the feature map size to (5x5).
Convolutional Layer 3: 64 filters with a kernel size of (3x3), resulting in feature maps of size (3x3).
The architecture diagram visually represents the structure of the CNN, illustrating the flow of data through convolutional and max-pooling layers.

3.	Max Pooling:

Max pooling is implemented after each convolutional layer to down sample the feature maps. It helps in reducing computational complexity and controlling overfitting by retaining the most important features while discarding irrelevant details. The effect of max pooling is documented by comparing the dimensions of feature maps before and after applying max pooling.

4.	Fully Connected Layer and Softmax:

After the convolutional layers, the output is flattened to a 1D array and passed through a fully connected layer with ReLU activation. This layer learns higher-level features from the extracted features. Finally, a fully connected layer with softmax activation is applied for classification, providing probabilities for each digit class.

5.	Training and Evaluation (Include Analysis):

The CNN model is trained on the MNIST dataset using the compiled model with Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross entropy loss function. During training, the model's performance is monitored by evaluating the training and validation accuracy and loss. The training process is documented by plotting the loss curves and accuracy metrics.
To evaluate the model's performance, it is tested on a separate test dataset. The accuracy metric is calculated to assess how well the model performs on unseen data. Additionally, K-Fold cross-validation is performed to validate the model's robustness and generalizeability. The confusion matrix is computed to analyze the model's performance in detail, identifying any misclassifications and potential areas for improvement.

6.	Documentation And Analysis:

Each component of the CNN implementation, including data preparation, model architecture, training, and evaluation, is explained thoroughly. The code is well-commented to enhance readability, providing clear explanations of each step. Analysis of the CNN implementation is provided, discussing the purpose and significance of each component in the context of digit recognition using CNNs.
